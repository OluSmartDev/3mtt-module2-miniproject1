# Click Counter APP

## Purpose: 
The objective of this project is to build a simple Click Counter using React state. Users should be able to increase or decrease the count by clicking on respective buttons.

## Requirements:
1. Use React functional component with hooks (useState).
2. Implement a clean UI with proper styling.
3. Ensure buttons properly update the state on click.


## Use Case:
The Click Counter App built in this project was created using React functional component that implemented useState hook. The component has three buttons but the third button (i.e. the Reset Button) is not displayed until a user hit either of the two edge cases. The edge cases of preventing the counter from going below zero and displaying a message if the counter reaches a threshold of 100 clicks were handled within the component. The component was styled using an external CSS linked to the component.
